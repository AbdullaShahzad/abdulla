							<h2>Hobbies</h2>
							<p>My Hobbie Is Reading,Reading adds lots of knowledge, the idea in our brain.
							When we read something new, we get new creative ideas that
							we might apply in real life. As a student, I love reading
							and it is my hobby. I am so much happy with my hobby.
							I spend most of my leisure time in the library.
							I am trying to build a home library and I am collecting
							books for that. Books are a good friend of ours. 
							Despite reading books, I love reading newspapers and
							magazines. Recently I have read the book Robinson
							Crusoe, a Novel by Daniel Defoe. That has been one of my favorite books ever.</p>
						</ul>

					<div class="details-col">
						<ul>
							<h2>Ambition</h2>
							<p>My aim in life has always been to become a successful software engineer.
								Software engineering is highly respected in the field of information
								technology as almost every field is associated with computers these days.
								The role of a software engineer becomes crucial in tapping the
								available sources to provide the best solution for issues faced.
								Checking out the latest software upgrades has to be considered 
								as well. Software engineering will help me in realizing my dream
								of making it big in the severe competition involved in the corporate market.</p>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="details-col">
						<ul>
							<h2>Career</h2>
							<p>I often wonder about my future as I am about to finish
								secondary school. The number one question on my mind
								is which profession should I choose? It is very hard 
								to make any definite choices, because I know they will
								affect me for the rest of my life. I want a profession
								that will satisfy me, challenge me, and bring me joy.
								I believe that a job should be like a hobby. I want to 
								love my work, and know that I am making a difference in 
								this world by helping other people.
								First of all, I want to finish secondary school.
								After My Education Ihave to Follow My Hobbie</p>
